	<p>
		BigQuery is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost analytics data warehouse. BigQuery is serverless, there is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator, so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights, use familiar SQL, and take advantage of our pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery is a powerful Big Data analytics platform used by all types of organizations, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.
