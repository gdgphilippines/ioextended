				Jonathan Joson is Google Philippines' Industry Manager for Performance Marketing, where he helps the country's largest banks and airlines grow their businesses online. Prior to Google, he worked for WPP’s Red Fuse Communications in Hong Kong as Regional Platform Strategy Director, working on digital strategy and implementation for Colgate-Palmolive’s brands in 9 markets across Asia. 
He graduated from Ateneo de Manila University in 2007 with degrees in Management Engineering and Economics - Honors, and was one seasonal subject short of a minor in English Literature (boohoo). He then worked in the Philippine digital advertising and media industry for seven years as one of the founding members of agency startup Media Contacts until it was absorbed into Havas Media Ortega. He has overseen client servicing, media planning, strategic planning, operations, and data & analytics, handling clients like Unilever, Nestle, Citibank, and Globe Telecom. 

An experienced comms and media planner, he has been recognized both locally and regionally for his work - he was named Southeast Asia Planner of the Year by Campaign Asia-Pacific in 2013, and was more recently awarded a Black Dragon certificate of excellence at the Dragons of Asia 2015.
