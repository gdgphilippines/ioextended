			<p>
				I am a digital marketing specialist with significant experience in strategic planning, media planning, performance-based marketing, as well as analytics and measurement.

I have category experience handling accounts in the FMCG industry (hair, skin, oral care, deos) and the financial sector (credit cards and personal loans), and have had experience handling different accounts across a variety of other industries.

A digital marketer by accident and an economist by background, I am equipped with quantitative skills that often let me look at complex problems from a different perspective.
